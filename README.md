# The-Sparks-Foundation-Internship

This repository contains ths tasks that I have completed as a Machine Learning Intern.

## Task 1

Completed LinkedIn based task.

## Task 2

Task to predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves two variables.

I was able carry out the predictions. Please refer to my [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1bxPcBr0Cng01rRP6R0GXP5OQOIEh91R7#scrollTo=TBr9xEByPgUf)

I have also created a flask app for this task to predict scores. It looks like :-

## Task 3

Task to create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically using Iris Dataset.

I have visualized the data in 2D and 3D graphs. Please refer to my [notebook](https://github.com/gauravsekhri/The-Sparks-Foundation-Internship/blob/master/Task%203/Task_3.ipynb)
